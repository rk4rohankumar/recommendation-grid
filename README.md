# Personalised Recommendation
## Introduction

Welcome to the "Recommendation System - The Cold Start" project repository! This project addresses the cold start problem in recommendation systems. Specifically, it focuses on recommending products to new customers who are visiting an e-commerce website for the first time or are new users with unknown preferences.

## The Cold Start Problem

The cold start problem is a common challenge in recommendation systems. When dealing with new customers or users, there is a lack of historical data and interactions to base recommendations on. This makes it difficult to provide personalized recommendations using traditional collaborative or content-based filtering methods. The solution lies in employing strategies that don't rely on user history.

## Solution: Popularity-Based Recommendations

The initial phase of the recommendation system is designed to cater to the needs of new customers. It addresses the challenge by employing a popularity-based strategy. Here's how it works:

1. **Product Popularity Analysis**: The system's algorithms analyze and identify the products that have gained the highest popularity and engagement across all users. These products are likely to have received numerous views, interactions, and purchases.

2. **Showcasing Popular Items**: When a new customer arrives on the website, the recommendation system highlights the most popular products. This captures their attention and helps them discover items that have already resonated with a broad user base.

3. **Leveraging Social Proof**: The recommendation system takes advantage of social proof – the tendency for individuals to trust and explore products that others find popular and desirable. By showcasing products with proven appeal, the system guides new customers through their initial exploration.

4. **Enhancing Customer Experience**: By focusing on product popularity, the system improves the chances of attracting new customers and making their first interactions with the website more fruitful. This contributes to customer acquisition, retention, and creating a positive first impression.

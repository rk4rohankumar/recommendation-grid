        "\n",
        "In this project, we aim to develop and evaluate a personalized recommendation system using collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering is a popular technique that leverages user-item interaction data to provide personalized recommendations to users. Our system will predict user preferences for items based on their past interactions and similarity to other users.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Goals\n",
        "\n",
        "The main goals of this project are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Develop a collaborative filtering model to generate personalized recommendations for users.\n",
        "- Implement an evaluation metric, the Personalized Click-Through Diversity Index (PCDI), to measure the performance of the recommendation system.\n",
        "- Incorporate user interaction data, such as clicks, add-to-cart actions, and ratings, to enhance the quality of recommendations.\n",

        "1. Data Preprocessing: We'll preprocess the user interaction data, including clicks, add-to-cart actions, and ratings, to create a utility matrix.\n",
        "2. Collaborative Filtering: We'll train a collaborative filtering model using the Surprise library, which will learn user and item embeddings to make personalized recommendations.\n",
        "3. Evaluation: We'll evaluate the model's performance using the PCDI metric, which combines click-through rate and diversity of recommendations.\n",
        "4. Interpretation: We'll analyze the results and gain insights into the effectiveness of the recommendation system.\n",

Each library serves a specific purpose in data processing, model development, interaction with external platforms, and synthetic data generation. Here's an overview of the libraries we're using and how they contribute to our project:\n",

        "- **Pandas and NumPy**: These libraries are fundamental for data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis. We'll use them to handle our dataframes and perform various operations on our data.\n",

        "- **Surprise Library**: Surprise is a powerful library for building recommendation systems. We'll use it to create collaborative filtering models and make user-product recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **SQLAlchemy and SQLite**: These libraries enable interaction with SQLite databases. We'll use them to store and retrieve data if necessary.\n",

However, obtaining real user interactions and preferences can be challenging during the initial stages of development. To address this, we have created a function called `generate_synthetic_data`.\n",

        "**Function Purpose:**\n",
        "The `generate_synthetic_data` function leverages the Faker library to generate synthetic user interactions for testing purposes. These interactions include user clicks, product add-to-cart actions, ratings, and timestamps. The generated data mimics real-world user behavior and allows us to validate the functionality of our recommendation system under various scenarios.\n",

        "**How It Works:**\n",
        "The function uses a loop to create a specified number of synthetic interactions (in this case, 10,000 interactions). For each interaction, it generates random values for user IDs, product IDs, click actions, add-to-cart actions, ratings, and timestamps.

To achieve this, we've developed the `create_sqlite_database` function, which facilitates the creation of an SQLite database and the import of synthetic data for testing and development purposes.\n",

The function reads this CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame and uses the DataFrame's `to_sql` method to insert the data into the 'user_interactions' table in the SQLite database. If the table already exists, the `if_exists` parameter is set to 'replace', meaning that any existing data is replaced with the new synthetic data.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Data Generation and Preparation:** We generated synthetic user interaction data and stored it in an SQLite database. This data included user-product interactions, such as clicks, add-to-cart actions, ratings, and timestamps.\n",

        "3. **PCDI Calculation:** We computed the PCDI metric by combining Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Diversity Score. CTR reflects user engagement with recommendations, while Diversity Score measures the variety of recommended items. A higher PCDI value indicates a balance between engagement and diversity.\n",

        "5. **Simulated Data:** We also demonstrated the application of PCDI on simulated data, showcasing how to calculate CTR, Diversity Score, and PCDI.\n",

        "By following the steps outlined in this notebook, you can effectively evaluate and improve your recommendation system's performance. Keep in mind that the weights assigned to CTR and Diversity Score can be adjusted based on your business objectives and user preferences. This approach provides a comprehensive way to assess recommendation quality, combining user interaction and item diversity in a single metric."
